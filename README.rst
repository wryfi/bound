bound
=====

``bound`` pulls data from `The Big Blocklist
Collection <https://firebog.net/>`__ and generates an
`unbound <https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/>`__ configuration file
that refuses lookup of the selected domains.

This is useful for blocking ads and malware, in much the same way as
`pi-hole <https://pi-hole.net/>`__. You might prefer this method over
pi-hole if:

-  you're already using unbound
-  you don't love dnsmasq (which pi-hole is based on)
-  you don't think a DNS resolver should require a web server
-  you distrust thousands of lines of bash to make major changes to your
   system

If the above don't apply to you, or you're looking for an opinionated,
ad-blocking resolver with a pretty user interface and automated
installer, `pi-hole <https://pi-hole.net/>`__ is probably what you want.

Requirements
------------

1. a gnu/linux or \*bsd operating system
2. a working unbound installation
3. python3.6+ (for debian-like systems:
   ``sudo apt-get install python3``)
4. python3 `requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/>`__ library (for
   debian-like systems: ``sudo apt-get install python3-requests``)

Installation
------------

``python setup.py install``

Usage
-----

``bound`` is intended to be used with blocklists from `The Big Blocklist
Collection <https://firebog.net/>`__.

Run without any options, ``bound`` will:

1. download the latest "ticked" list from the Big Blocklist Collection
2. download all of the blocklists listed in the "ticked" list
3. parse, deduplicate, and assemble a list of domains from the retrieved
   blocklists
4. remove any safelisted domains from the list
5. write ``/etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/blocklist.conf`` to configure
   unbound for blocking the listed domains
6. check the unbound configuration, and exit in case of any errors
7. restart unbound

To accomplish the above, you will probably need to run ``bound`` as the
root user.

There are options that support running as a non-root user, as well as
specifying the blocklist URL, an optional safelist URL, and local
blocklist and safelist files.

For a description of all the options, run ``bound -h``.
